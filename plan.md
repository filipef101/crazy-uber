# Crazy Uber Game Development Plan

## Project Overview
A Three.js-based game inspired by Crazy Taxi where players pick up and deliver passengers around a city map.

## Core Features
- 3D city environment with buildings, roads, and obstacles
- Drivable vehicle with realistic physics (acceleration, braking, drifting)
- Passenger pickup and dropoff mechanics
- Time-based scoring system
- Visual effects (skid marks, smoke, etc.)
- Sound effects and music
- Mini-map for navigation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Framework ✓
- Basic Three.js environment setup ✓
- Rendering loop and window resizing ✓
- Camera controls ✓

### Phase 2: Map and Environment ✓
- City grid with roads ✓
- Basic buildings ✓
- Ground textures ✓
- Fog and visual distance settings ✓

### Phase 3: Vehicle Implementation ✓
- Car model in the scene ✓
- Vehicle physics (acceleration, braking, steering) ✓
- Camera following the car ✓
- Drift mechanics ✓

### Phase 4: Gameplay Mechanics (Next Focus)
- Passenger generation at random locations
- Destination markers
- Pickup/dropoff interaction
- Timer and score system
- Arrow pointing to destination
- Money/points popup on successful delivery

### Phase 5: Enhanced Physics and Collision
- Improved collision detection with buildings and obstacles
- Car damage system
- Bouncing/response physics
- Better drifting mechanics with skid marks

### Phase 6: User Interface
- Main menu
- Game HUD (time, score, current fare)
- Minimap enhancements
- Game over screen
- Leaderboard

### Phase 7: Audio and Visual Polish
- Engine sounds
- Collision sounds
- Background music
- Particle effects (exhaust, skid marks)
- Lighting improvements
- Day/night cycle

### Phase 8: Optimization and Performance
- Asset loading optimization
- Level of detail (LOD) system
- Frustum culling improvements
- Mobile compatibility

### Phase 9: Final Polish and Release
- Bug fixes
- Playtesting and balancing
- Final optimization pass
- Release version
