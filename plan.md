Crazy Uber Game Development Plan
I'd be happy to help you plan out your "Crazy Uber" game inspired by Crazy Taxi using Three.js! Let's start with a structured plan to achieve your initial goals of creating a map, adding a car, and implementing driving mechanics.
Project Overview
Your game will need:

A 3D environment (city map)
A drivable vehicle with physics
Camera controls that follow the vehicle
Basic collision detection

Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Project Setup

Create the basic Three.js environment
Set up the rendering loop and window resizing
Implement basic camera controls

Phase 2: Map Creation

Design a simple city grid with roads
Add basic buildings and obstacles
Create ground textures for roads and sidewalks

Phase 3: Vehicle Implementation

Add a car model to the scene
Implement vehicle physics (acceleration, braking, steering)
Set up camera to follow the car
